# CREATE A MOVIE WEBSITE

- This is a project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanogegree (IPND).
  - It is the 4th project for IPND.

# How to use it:
- First download Python interpreter (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Open the entertainment_center.py and run it in the interpreter.
- An HTML file should be created.

I could put the HTML file inside, but would make no sence as this project should demonstrate the knowing of Python language.

# .zip file contains:
- README.md
- entertainment_center.py
- fresh_tomatoes.py
- media.py
- folder img:
  - cinema-canvas.jpg
